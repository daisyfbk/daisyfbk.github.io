  title: Robust Anomaly Detection in Critical Infrastructure
  institution: University of Trento
  year: 2022
  supervisor: DomenicoSiracusa
  co-supervisor: RobertoDoriguzziCorin
  abstract: >
    Critical Infrastructures (CIs) such as water treatment plants, power grids and telecommunication networks are critical to the daily activities and well-being of our society. Disruption of such CIs would have catastrophic consequences for public safety and the national economy. Hence, these infrastructures have become major targets in the upsurge of cyberattacks. Defending against such attacks often depends on an arsenal of cyber-defence tools, including Machine Learning (ML)-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs). These detection systems use ML models to learn the profile of the normal behaviour of a CI and classify deviations that go well beyond the normality profile as anomalies. [...]
