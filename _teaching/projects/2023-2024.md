          title: Identifying Anomaly Behavior in Container Orchestrator Auditing Logs
          description: >
            Kubernetes is the facto container orchestrator in public and private clouds. It presents many features that facilitate the management not only of containers but also several elements that help implement more complex applications, like secrets, configmaps, services, and ingresses. All the configurations are handled through an API that manages the access using an RBAC system. These requests to the API are logged by the auditing module, which can be configured with different granularity. If a User or Service Account is compromised, some malicious actor can execute commands to obtain confidential information, like passwords or application topologies. Given the substantial volume of logged events, threshold-based or string-pattern matching algorithms can not be enough to identify malicious behavior in the cluster. So, this project aims to explore the state-of-the-art and compare existing anomaly detection algorithms and their applicability to auditing logs.

          title: System calls misuse detection in containerized systems
          description: >
            Containers have arisen as a lightweight alternative to virtual machines (VMs).  While they have become the industry standard for deploying microservices, container security remains the foremost concern and a significant obstacle to adoption for numerous companies.
            Containers, as bundles of applications and services packaged together, are susceptible to software bugs or to the inclusion of malware, whether intentionally or inadvertently. These anomalous programs possess the same capabilities as any other component within the container image, making them potential threats to other containers or hosts within the ecosystem.
            The goal of this project is to investigate Machine Learning (ML) methods to detect container anomalies through the analysis of their systems calls, i.e., of their interactions with the kernel of the hosting machine.

          title: Robustness of Intrusion Detection Systems against Adversarial Machine Learning attacks
          description: >
            A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) serves as the initial line of defence against network attacks that threaten the integrity of data, systems, and networks. Over recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been increasingly used in NIDSs to detect malicious traffic due to their remarkable accuracy in identifying malicious network activity. Nonetheless, DNNs exhibit susceptibility to Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks, where subtle alterations to input data can lead to misclassification by the neural network. This vulnerability has particularly severe consequences, as adversarial attacks pose a substantial threat to overall network security.
            While the majority of current research in the field of AML has been directed towards computer vision tasks like image classification and object recognition, there has been a notable increase in interest and activity within the cybersecurity domain. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in this domain, encompassing both performance-related issues and the practicality of applying these methods to real-world scenarios. 
            The primary objective of this project is to explore innovative and practical methodologies aimed at enhancing the resilience of NIDSs against AML attacks.
