project: FLEXIA
funding: Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (MASE)

goals: >
  As a result of energy transition and decarbonisation policies promoted at national and European level, the need for energy flexibility in Europe is set to grow dramatically over time. FLEXIA aims to support the aggregation of different Energy Management Systems (EMSs) with the goal of optimising the flexibility of collaborative demand from industries in close physical proximity. More specifically, the CyberSecurity Center will handle the task of data ingestion and management, while also perfoming sanity check and anomaly detection procedures as to further enforce the security posture of the final solution. Moreover, the Center will also develop common APIs that will allow all software components to reliably communicate with each other.
