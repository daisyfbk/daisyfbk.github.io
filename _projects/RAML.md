    Raman amplification is a promising technology to increase the capacity of existing fiber plants, by supporting the direct optical amplification of spectrum bands outside the usual C band. In this project, FBK develops and engineers Machine Learning (ML) techniques to tune Raman amplifiers, for both the C and L bands.
