    FLUIDOS (Flexible, scaLable, secUre, and decentralIseD Operating System) aims to leverage the enormous, unused processing capacity at the edge, scattered across heterogeneous edge devices that struggle to integrate with each other and to coherently form a seamless computing continuum. FBK is leader of the ”Seamless, zero-trust security and privacy” work package and its research is focused on anomaly detection, security orchestration and cyber deception.
