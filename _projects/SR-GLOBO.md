    The goal of SR-GLOBO project is to design and evaluate traffic engineering algorithms that optimize bandwidth utilization in response to congestion in large telecom provider networks, leveraging segment routing. The objectives are to (1) prove that the knowledge of local counters can be sufficient to design effective traffic engineering algorithms,(2) propose a novel optimization algorithm that, based on such knowledge, achieves decongestion leveraging its global understanding of the network status, (3) analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm and previously developed ones in challenging scenarios where scalability and timeliness are important constraints.
