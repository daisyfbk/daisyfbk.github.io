    The vision of SPIDER is to deliver a next-generation, extensive, and replicable cyber range platform for the telecommunications domain and its fifth generation (5G), offering cybersecurity emulation, training and investment decision support. Towards this vision, it features integrated tools for cyber testing including advanced emulation tools, novel training methods based on active learning as well as econometric models based on real-time emulation of modern cyber-attacks. SPIDER supports both self-paced and team-based exercising and acts as a serious gaming repository for multiple stakeholders to share training material and maximise efficiency in delivering complex cyber exercises. The proposed cyber range model will be vali- dated in five highly realistic pilot use case scenarios.
