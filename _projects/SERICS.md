    The project aims at supporting the secure development and deployment of containerized applications on distributed and heterogeneous architectures. This will be achieved by extending and integrating existing security assessment methodologies (e.g., SAST, DAST, and Code review) into the DevOps CI/CD pipeline. FBKâ€™s role in the project is to investigate runtime monitoring and anomaly detection of non-compliant containers when the microservice application is executed in production.
