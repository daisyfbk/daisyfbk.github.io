    The project addresses the EU objectives promoted in the Green Deal and Cybersecurity strategies by innovating the multi-provider cloud-edge continuum. Specifically, the project emphasises the creation of security, privacy-enhancing, and trust-aware services to ensure resilience and compliance in distributed AI-enabled applications.
    This involves: (i) developing techniques for dynamically deploying and tuning AI-based security functions by analysing various operational parameters (e.g., threat levels, security policies, high-priority processes running on edge devices, budget); (ii) creating methods to collaboratively train AI models for cyber-threat detection while ensuring the confidentiality of participantsâ€™ sensitive data; (iii) enhancing the robustness of AI-based security functions to handle unforeseen network events, concept drift, and adversarial machine learning attacks.
