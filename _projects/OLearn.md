project: OLearn 
funding: Cisco Systems Inc., by means of University Research Program (URP) funding
goals: >
    OLearn is a project that aims to explore the potential of applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques to improve the control and management of backbone optical networks. OLearn investigates which scenarios in optical networking are suitable for self-optimization and automation via specific ML techniques, and propose solutions that will be validated via proof-of-concept demonstrations.
