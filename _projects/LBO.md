    The goal of the Local Bandwidth Optimization (LBO) project is to study the benefits of decentralized methods for the optimization of bandwidth in large Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. To this account, this project builds up on previous theoretical studies to formalize and evaluate decentralized solutions for bandwidth optimization based on purely distributed or clustered approaches and leveraging the Segment Routing concept with the aim of (i) providing scalability in terms of fast and frequent re-optimization, (ii) avoiding a single point of failure, and (iii) ensuring feasibility when the network is oblivious of the full/partial traffic demands.
