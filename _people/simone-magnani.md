Simone Magnani is a PhD student jointly at *Università di Genova* and *Fondazione Bruno Kessler*. He obtained his BSc in *Computer Science and Engineering* at *Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna* and received his MSc *cum Laude* in *Computer Engineering* at *Politecnico di Torino*

His main research focus is on AI-based methodologies for threat detection at the Edge, including lightweight and opportunistic network traffic monitoring for intrusion detection. He is currently collaborating with *IBM Research Europe* in Ireland for the design and development of a novel *Continual Learning* and *Knowledge Distillation* algorithm, aiming at training and deploying deep learning-based early-warning systems with lower footprints and restricted feature sets on resource-constrained devices.

In the free time, he enjoys hiking and running.
