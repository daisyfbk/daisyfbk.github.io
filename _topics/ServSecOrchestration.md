Service orchestration, in a broader context, refers to the coordination
and automation of multiple services or processes to achieve a specific
outcome efficiently and seamlessly. It is not limited to cybersecurity
but can be applied to various domains such as IT, telecommunications,
cloud computing, and business process management. It plays a crucial
role in modern IT and business operations, allowing organizations to
deliver services and achieve their objectives with greater speed,
flexibility, and reliability.

Our focus:

- Devise service allocation algorithms that effectively use available
  resources and develop tools for automating the orchestration of
  workloads
- Propose strategies that effectively deploys security applications
  without affecting the quality of service of business applications
- Traffic engineering, effective control and orchestration for
  circuit- and packet-based networks
