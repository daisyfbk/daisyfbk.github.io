Decepto works as controller extending the Kubernetes API to automatically clone
individual microservices from any cloud-native application and configures them
as high-interaction decoys interwoven with the production environment.
Additionally, each decoy is equipped with advanced functionalities to detect
and monitor malicious activity effectively. By using decoys that mimic legitimate
system components, service providers can reliably detect and monitor stealthy attackers.

Ongoing developments aim to improve the orchestration algorithm behind Decepto with the aim to satisfy pre-defined security requirements, while ensuring a minimal resource utilisation and no interference with the cloud-native applications.

The code of Decepto is available on [GitHub](https://gitlab.fbk.eu/cyber-deception/decepto).
