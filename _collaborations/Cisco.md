Active since 2006, the RiSING unit collaborates with [Cisco Systems Inc.](https://www.cisco.com), a worldwide leader in networking and telecommunications. The primary research activities are focused on the definition and development of new control plane protocols for dynamically switching optical networks. Our unit develops and maintains a Java library for the Path Computation Element, the functional entity responsible for the routing and the resource allocation on optical networks. This PCE specializes in the selection of optimal paths through a network, resource allocation, as well as in the validation of the feasibility of optical lightpath routes.

Cisco is a member of the Executive Tecnical Board of the [Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF)](https://www.oiforum.com/) and is a leader in defining the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm.
