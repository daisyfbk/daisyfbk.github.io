# Who we are

The Robust and Secure Distributed Computing (RiSING) research unit aims to investigate and implement smart, autonomic and anti-fragile methods and platforms that leverage on management and orchestration of processing, storage and networking resources to enhance resiliency, dependability and security of distributed computing infrastructures covering the whole the cloud-to-things continuum.

The RiSING unit lies within the [Cybersecurity center](https://www.fbk.eu/it/cybersecurity/) in [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu) (FBK).
